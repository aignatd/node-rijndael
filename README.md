node-rijndael
=============

A native binding to mcrypt's rijndael encryption with a block size of 256 bits. This allows for the encryption and decryption of data generated by Drupal, which uses rijndael-256, despite the AES standard of rijndael-128.

Installation
============

You _will_ need a development version of libmcrypt installed on your system to build node-rijndael.

```sh
$ npm install node-rijndael
```

<small>If you know how to package an external library with a Node Addon, consider submitting a [pull request][pr].</small>

API
===

For simplicity's sake, node-rijndael only operates on Buffers. You may, of course, convert your strings into buffers with `new Buffer`.

new Rijndael(key, [encoding])
-----------------------------

The constructor creates a Rijndael object bound to a specific key, with methods for encrypting and decrypting. If you don't care for an object bound to a key, use the [encrypt][] and [decrypt][] functions exported by node-rijndael.

The provided key can be either a `Buffer` or a `string`, and if a string is provided, the encoding parameter must also be provided.

Rijndael.encrypt(plaintext)
---------------------------

Encrypt the provided `plaintext` with the bound key, and return the encrypted `ciphertext`. Both `plaintext` and `ciphertext` must be a `Buffer`.

Rijndael.decrypt(plaintext)
---------------------------

Decrypt the provided `ciphertext` with the bound key, and return the decrypted `plaintext`. Both `plaintext` and `ciphertext` must be a `Buffer`.

rijndael.encrypt(plaintext, key)
--------------------------------

Encrypt the provided `plaintext` with the provided `key`, and return the encrypted `ciphertext`. All variables involved must be instances of `Buffer`.

rijndael.decrypt(ciphertext, key)
--------------------------------

Encrypt the provided `ciphertext` with the provided `key`, and return the encrypted `plaintext`. All variables involved must be instances of `Buffer`.
